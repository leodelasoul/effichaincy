P3:
„HTML 5 kurz&gut“ was the book I picked up.
This book is an instance of the O‘Reily kurz&gut books since there‘s several books with the same
structure as this one, just the subject varies (JavaScript,CSS,..)
P4:
It belongs to the class „Book“
- 3 parameters: title, price, date
- title = string, price = double
I downloaded the project folder from GitHub.
- found Bluej in “programs“ to make sure I had Bluej installed
- opened package.bluej in Bluej
1.
- we found out we needed to compile the class “Circle“ first by right clicking on it and then clicking on
“compile“
- compiled the other classes as well
- right click on Circle → new Circle() → created circle 1
- found out that we had to add a test “Canvas“ by right clicking on the actual class and then going
on “Create Test Class NOW“
- then we added a circle like I did before, compiled it and then by right clicking on the test onject
“Text Fixture to Object Bench“ the circle was still there. And that was weird..
- added triangle, clicked on “Obect Bench to Text Fixture“, then on Replace and compiled
everything. By clicking on “Text Fixture to Object Bench“ again the triangle came back
→ I‘m gonna do that after every added object, but will skip writing this step down from now on
